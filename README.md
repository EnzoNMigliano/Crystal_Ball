Automated Algorithm to predict the stock market ðŸ”®

For this project we created a total of six stock price classification models. The models will identify if a stock will increase by 5%, decrease by 2%, or neither in 30 minutes. We will build a function-based code that analyzes historical stock data for 6 months and determine the accuracy, recall, and precision of each model's 1-month, 1-minute price testing data. We will also find out if the accuracies are significantly different from one another to determine which model is the best. Finally, we will analyze if the models are overfit.

We will start our project by building the following models: **Time Series, MARS, Random Forrest, Support Vector Machine, Deep Learning, and Auto Machine Learning.**
For each model we will predict
